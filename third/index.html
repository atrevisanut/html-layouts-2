<!--This is the title-->
					<h1 id="font-size">Dinosaurs: Curse Your Sudden But <br>Inevitable Betrayal!</h1>
<!--content of the page-->
					<p>We come into the middle of a battle. Soldiers are yelling and running, gunfire everywhere, stuff blowing up but good.
Camera focuses on a soldier in the silhouette of an explosion, running and dodging fire. He hits the dirt for cover. We PUSH IN and see that it's Mal. His face is dirty and he's breathing hard.
Mal's up again and running to rejoin his company in a makeshift foxhole.
RADIO OPERATOR
Sergeant, Command says air support is holding
till they can assess our status.
MAL
Our status is that we need some gorram air support.
Now get back on line and tell 'em to get in here.
ZOE
That skiff is shredding us, sir.
RADIO OPERATOR
They won't move without a lieutenant's
authorization code, sir.
Angry, Mal walks over and rips off the badge from a dead Lieutenant's uniform and gives it to the Radio Operator.
MAL
Here, here's your code. You're Lieutenant Baker.
Congratulations on your promotion. Now get me
some air support!
(to Zoe)
Pull back, just enough to wedge 'em in here. Get your
squad to high ground, start picking 'em off.ZOE
High ground is death with that skiff in the air.
MAL
That's our problem. Thanks for volunteering.
(to Bendis)
Bendis, give us some cover fire. We're going
duck hunting.
The foxhole is rocked by a huge explosion. Mal's group of soldiers are looking pretty young and scared. Time for a morale boost:
MAL
Just focus!
(beat)
The Alliance said they were gonna waltz through 
Serenity Valley and we choked 'em with those words.
We've done the impossible and that makes us mighty.
Just a little while longer, our angels are gonna be 
soaring overhead raining fire on those arrogant cod,
so you hold!
(yelling)
You hold! Go!
His soldiers take up their positions to lay down cover fire while Mal and Zoe prepare to take down the skiff.
ZOE
Really think we can bring her down, sir?
MAL
Do you even need to ask?
Mal pulls a necklace out from under his shirt and kisses the cross.
MAL
Ready?
ZOE
Always.
Mal takes off. Zoe prepares to follow, sees that no one's covering Mal.
ZOE
Bendis? Bendis!
She sees Bendis huddled across from her, scared stiff.
ZOE (cont'd)
(angrily)
Rut it.
Zoe grunts and stands up, laying cover fire for Mal as he moves down the hill. After a moment, she follows Mal down the hill, taking cover with him behind some boulders. Mal fires into the bushes, causing the soldier guarding a bigass gun to move out of his cover and return fire. Mal shoots him dead.
Mal activates the bigass gun's targeting system while Zoe covers him. Mal locks a target on the skiff that's been killing them in the battle and fires. He makes a direct hit and stands back from the bigass gun.
MAL
Yeah!
(manly grunt)
Then Mal realizes that the skiff is outta control... and headed right for him. Oh, shit. Mal starts running.
MAL
Zoe!
Mal and Zoe run as the skiff hits the ground and plows past them, exploding. Mal and Zoe hit the ground flat on their backs. Mal starts laughing. Zoe looks long-suffering.
ZOE
(entering foxhole,
to Bendis)
Nice cover fire.
MAL
Did you see that? Green, what's our 
status on...
Mal trails off as he realizes Green is pretty damn wounded, possibly deader than a dead thing.
MAL
Zoe.
She looks up. Mal points.  Zoe moves to check Green. Mal moves to sit near Bendis.
MAL (cont'd)
Hey, listen to me. Bendis, look at me! Listen,
we're holding this valley no matter what.
BENDIS
We're gonna die.
MAL
We're not gonna die. We can't die, Bendis.
You know why?
(beat)
Because we are so very pretty. We are just too pretty
for God to let us die. Huh? Look at that chiseled jaw.
Huh? C'mon.
There's a roaring sound overhead. Zoe is listening on the radio.
MAL (cont'd)
If you won't listen to me, listen to 

<!--This is where the grey box has been inserted-->
<div class="box"></div>that. Those are


our angels coming to blow the Alliance to the hot place.
(to Zoe)
Zoe, tell the 82nd --
ZOE
(stunned)
They're not coming.
(beat)
Command says it's too hot. They're pulling out. We're to
lay down arms.
Mal's stunned, in denial. He looks at Bendis.
MAL
But what's...
Slowly, Mal stands and peeks over the top of the foxhole. His face is lit from their air support rising and retreating. Bendis stands next to him. Mal's in shock, watching his last hope pull out of the fight.
Beside him, Bendis is hit by enemy fire and falls. Mal doesn't notice.
PUSH IN on Mal's bloody face. On the disbelief.
INT. BLOWN-OUT SHIP - NIGHT
We are in some kind of burnt out wreck - all we see is twisted black metal, a few stars visible through breaches in the hull.
From top of frame, Mal floats upside-down into a close up. He is in a space suit. The title reads
SIX YEARS LATER
MAL
The vault's sealed.
(beat)
Okay. I'm gonna boil it. Jayne, give
me the sticky.
WIDEN to see Zoe and Jayne also suited up. They are in zero gravity, floating by a big iron door.
Jayne hands Mal an object that looks like a glue gun. Mal squeezes the trigger and clear gel comes out with a line running through it. He paints a line around the outside of the door.
ANGLE: THE GEL
as it eats through the door.
MAL
Okay. We get the goods, we're off this wreck and
back on the ship. No worries.
PULL BACK rapidly through the burnt out ship to REVEAL Serenity.
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Wash sits in the pilot's seat. He's concentrating intensely.
WASH
Everything looks good from here...
(beat)
Yes. Yes, this is a fertile land,
and we will thrive.
He's playing with little plastic dinosaurs. He holds a Stegosaurus and a T-Rex.
The dinosaurs look out over his dash/console, toward the window.
WASH (cont'd)
(as Stegosaurus)
We will rule over all this land, and
we will call it... "This Land."
(as T-Rex)
I think we should call it "your
grave!"
(Stegosaurus)
Ah, curse your sudden but inevitable
betrayal!
(T-Rex)
Ha ha HA! Mine is an evil laugh! Now
die!
(Stegosaurus)
Oh, no, God! Oh, dear God in heaven!
He makes them fight. As he does, a light near him flashes red.
He stops fighting, looks, then looks at a sort of radar screen.
ANGLE: THE RADAR SCREEN
has got three other dinosaurs on it. He sweeps them off as a blip appears in the upper right quadrant, closing fast.
WASH (cont'd)
Oh, motherless son of a b--
INT. BLOWN-OUT SHIP - CONTINUING
A piece of metal goes flying past Jayne.
ZOE
Full pressure. The goods must be intact.
ANGLE: INSIDE THE CHAMBER
Three crates, roughly the size of hay bales, sit in the dark.
MAL (cont'd)
Okay. Looking good.
A voice sounds simultaneously in all three headsets: Wash.
WASH (O.S.)
Captain, we got incoming! Alliance cruiser,
bearing right down on us!
MAL
(in Chinese)
[Ta ma de. -- "Oh shit!"]
(in English)
Have they spotted us?
WASH
I can't tell if --
MAL
Have they hailed us?
JAYNE
If they're here for the salvage,
we're humped.
ZOE
If they find us at all, we're humped.
Thievin' ain't exactly --
JAYNE
I don't like this.
MAL
(in Chinese)
[Shut up.]
(in English)
Wash, shut it down, Wash. Everything but
the air.
INT. SERENITY - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
WASH
Shutting down.
He is flipping switches, we hear engines running down, lights go off - he hits the com:
