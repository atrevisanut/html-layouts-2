				<p class="home-page-text">This Is Spinal Tap is a 1984 American rock music mockumentary comedy film written, scored by, and starring Rob Reiner, <br>Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer. The film portrays the fictional British heavy metal band Spinal Tap. Directed<br> by Reiner, the movie satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of hard rock and heavy metal bands, <br>as well as the hagiographic tendencies of rock documentaries of the time. <br>

<br>Reiner and the three main actors are credited as the writers of the movie because they ad libbed much of the dialogue. Several <br> hours of footage were filmed before Reiner edited it to the released movie.<br>

<br>The three main members of Spinal Tap—David St. Hubbins, Derek Smalls and Nigel Tufnel—are played by actors McKean, <br>Shearer, and Guest, respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the<br> movie. Reiner appears as Marty Di Bergi, the maker of the documentary. Other actors in the movie are Tony Hendra as group manager<br> Ian Faith, and June Chadwick as St. Hubbins' interfering girlfriend Jeanine. Actors Paul Shaffer, Fred Willard, Fran Drescher,<br> Bruno Kirby, Howard Hesseman, Ed Begley, Jr., Patrick Macnee, Anjelica Huston, Vicki Blue, Dana Carvey, Billy Crystal, Brinke Stevens, <br>and Linnea Quigley all play supporting roles or make cameo appearances in the movie.<br>

<br>In 2002, This Is Spinal Tap was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress and <br>was selected for preservation by the United States National Film Registry.</p>
